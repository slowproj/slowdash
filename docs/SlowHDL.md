# Overview
SlowPy HDL provides a Verilog-like style for describing control sequences in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as VHDL or Verilog, you may find it confusing at first. Consider avoiding this feature if you are not comfortable with HDL concepts.

However, for users experienced with parallel state-machine design, SlowPy HDL offers a straightforward approach.
It was originally designed to replace legacy PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) systems, allowing ladder logic to be directly translated into SlowPy HDL processes.


### Example
For a control system that consists of a counter display and start / stop / clear buttons:
```python
from slowpy.control import control_system as ctrl

start_btn = ctrl.value(initial_value=False).oneshot()
stop_btn = ctrl.value(initial_value=False).oneshot()
clear_btn = ctrl.value(initial_value=False).oneshot()
display = ctrl.value()

def _export():
    return [
        ('start', start_btn.writeonly()),
        ('stop', stop_btn.writeonly()),
        ('clear', clear_btn.writeonly()),
        ('display', display.readonly())
    ]
```

We will build a counter that can be started, stopped, or cleared, and its current value is shown on the display.

If this were to be implemented in FPGA, a Verilog code block (excluding RESET) would look like:
```verilog
module Counter(clock, start, stop, clear, count);
    input clock;
    input start;
    input stop;
    input clear;
    output reg[7:0] count;
    reg running;

    always @(posedge clock) 
    begin
        if (stop == 1'b1)
            running <= 1'b0;
        else if (start == 1'b1)
            running <= 1'b1;
    end

    always @(posedge clock) 
    begin
        if (clear == 1'b1)
            count <= 8'd0;
        else if (running == 1'b1)
            if (count == 8'd59)
                count <= 8'd0;
            else
                count <= count + 8'd1;
    end
endmodule
```

The SlowPy-HDL code (Python software script; emulation of HDL behavior) has basically the same structure:
```python
from slowpy.control.hdl import *

# control module, with inputs and outputs given in the __init()__ arguments
class CounterModule(Module):
    def __init__(self, clock, start, stop, clear, count):
        super().__init__(clock)

        # internal registers and binding of inputs and outputs
        self.start = input_reg(start)
        self.stop = input_reg(stop)
        self.clear = input_reg(clear)
        self.count = output_reg(count)
        self.running = reg()

        # initialization (RESET)
        self.count <= 0
        self.running <= False
                
    @always
    def startstop(self):
        if self.stop:
            self.running <= False
        elif self.start:
            self.running <= True

    @always
    def update(self):
        if self.clear:
            self.count <= 0
        elif self.running:
            if self.count == 59:
                self.count <= 0
            else:
                self.count <= int(self.count) + 1


# Create an instance, map peripherals (SlowPy control nodes)

clock = Clock(Hz=1)

counter = CounterModule(
    clock,
    start = start_btn,
    stop = stop_btn,
    clear = clear_btn,
    count = display
)

clock.start()
```
Here the `@always` decorator and the `<=` operator are abused to mimic the Verilog syntax. In SlowPy HDL, module arguments are all registers (except for the clock). Register initializations, typically done with RESET in FPGA, can be done in the `__init__()` function.

SlowPy HDL behaves like HDL. The following code works as if it were written in Verilog:
```python
class TestModule(Module):
    def __init__(self, clock, a, b):
        super().__init__(clock)
        self.a = output_reg(a)
        self.b = output_reg(b)
        
        self.a <= 'A'
        self.b <= 'B'
        
    @always
    def swap_ab(self):
        self.a <= self.b
        self.b <= self.a
```
In this example, the contents of `self.a` and `self.b` are swapped on every clock cycle.
If this were standard Python assignment in a single pass (software-like behavior), both variables would simply end up with the value 'B' instead.



# Construct

## Typical Code Structure
```python

# SlowPy Control Nodes to control (external devices etc.)
from slowpy.control import control_system as ctrl
node1 = ctrl.whatever()....
node2 = ctrl.whatever()....
...

from slowpy.control.hdl import *

# user class to implement the logic
class MyModule(Module):
    def __init__(self, clock, var1, var2, ...):
        # clock binding (base class initialization)
        super().__init__(clock)
        
        # registers and input/output binding
        self.var1 = input_reg(var1)    # register for input
        self.var2 = output_reg(var2)   # register for output
        self.var3 = reg()              # internal register
        ...

        # initial values
        self.var2 <= 0
        self.var3 <= 0
        ...
        
    # recurrent process (called on every clock cycle)
    @always
    def process1(self):
        if int(self.var1) == 1:   # condition on register values
            self.var1 <= ...      # rhs: expression on register values, lhs: register to update
        else:
            self.var2 <= ...

    @always
    def process2(self):
        ...
        
        
# create instances
clock = Clock(Hz=1)
module = MyModule(clock, var1=node1, var2=node2, ...)


# starting the thread for standalone execution; for use in SlowTask, see below.
if __name__ == '__main__':
   clock.start()
```

## Behavior
In SlowPy HDL, each user-defined Module is driven by a Clock that runs in its own thread. At the beginning of every clock cycle, the module reads new values from input registers (which are bound to external nodes). Then, all methods marked with the `@always` decorator are called in sequence. Any assignments made with the `<=` operator are scheduled to update on the next clock cycle, closely mirroring synchronous, non-blocking behavior in HDLs. This design effectively reproduces parallel, clock-driven state machines in Python.

- Module implements the user logic, and clock calls user methods recurrently in a dedicated thread.
- External control variables (SlowPy control nodes) are assigned to module's internal registers for input, output, or both.
- The methods in the module decorated with `@always` is called on every clock cycle.
- Register values are assigned with the `<=` operator. The assigned value takes effect on the next clock cycle.


## Components
In SlowPy HDL, your design is built on three key components: Modules, Clocks, and Registers. A `Module` encapsulates the core logic, while a `Clock` manages timing by triggering the module’s processes on each cycle. `Register`s store and transfer data between cycles, mimicking the behavior of flip-flops in traditional hardware. The sections below explain how these elements interact to form a synchronous, HDL-like environment in Python.

### Module
User modules must be derived from the `Module` class defined in `slowpy.control.hdl`. The constructor (`__init__()`) of the `Module` class takes an argument for an instance of the `Clock` class described below. The user class methods that are decorated with `@always` will be called on each clock cycle.

### Clock
A Clock defines the interval at which the module processes are triggered.
Each `Clock` instance runs in its own thread, created when you call `start()`.
A `Clock` object is passed to `Module` instances so it can repeatedly invoke their `@always` methods at the specified frequency.

It is possible and maybe useful to create multiple clocks at different frequencies. For example, if a device is slow and readout from it takes time, a slow clock can be used to (pre)fetch the data from the device.

### Register
This implements the flip-flop behavior. The value of a register is updated on clock cycles. If the register is bound to an input from a node (by `register = input_reg(node)` or `register = inout_reg(node)`), the `get()` of the bound node is called just before every clock cycle and the value is held until the next cycle. If the register is bound to an output to a node (by `register = output_reg(node)` or `register = inout_reg(node)`), the assigned register value is written to the node by callling `set(value)` right after every clock cycle. If a register is not bound to a node, the assigned value will take effect on the next clock cycle.

The `<=` operator is overloaded to handle register assignments.
If you need to use it for a numeric comparison instead, cast the register to an integer first (e.g., `if int(reg) <= 31:`).

The content of a register is just a Python value, therefore any Python value types can be stored, not limited to numerical types.


# Using in SlowTask
Note that each `Clock` instance runs in its own thread.
When using in a SlowTask, use the `_run()` and `_halt()` methods to start and stop this thread respectively.



```python
#... Variable Nodes

class MyModule(Module):
#...

clock = Clock(Hz=1)
module = MyModule(
    clock,
    #...
)


# SlowTask callbacks

def _run():
    clock.start()   # start the clocking thread
    clock.join()    # wait for the thread to terminate

def _halt():
    clock.stop()    # stop the thread


# for standalone execution (not in SlowTask)
if __name__ == '__main__':
   clock.start()
```

Important: `_run()` should finish only after the clock thread has stopped.
If the thread remains active and you call `_run()` again, you will end up with multiple clock threads running concurrently.


# Internal Implementation
Under the hood, SlowPy HDL uses a dedicated clock thread that coordinates module processes and register updates.
During initialization, each module is scanned for registers (both input and output) and methods marked with `@always`.
On every clock cycle, the clock object reads new data into input registers, invokes all `@always` methods, writes updated values to output registers, and finally copies all “next-cycle” assignments into the registers.
This sequence ensures that SlowPy HDL behaves much like a synchronous hardware description language.

#### Structure
- When the `Module` class is initialized with a clock, it registers itself to the clock object, so that the clock object knows all the modules under its control.

- During initialization, the clock object scans each module to:
  - Identify all register members (`isinstance(member, Register)`),
  - Find all process methods (those with the `@always` decorator).

- Each register has two internal values, one for reading and one for writing, in addition to the bound node.
  - Reading from a register returns the reading value.
  - The overloaded operator `register <= rhs` sets the rhs value to the register writing value.

#### Node-Register Binding
- The `input_reg(node)` function creates a register bound to the node and mark it for reading.
- The `output_reg(node)` function creates a register bound to the node and mark it for writing. Reading from this register returns the value written on the last clock, instead of getting a value from the bound node.
- The `inout_reg(node)` function creates a register bound to the node and marks it for both reading and writing.
- The `reg()` function creates a register not bound to any nodes. Reading from it returns the value written on the last clock.

#### Sequence
- A clocking thread is started by `Clock.start()`. In the thread, the clock object repeatedly performs:
  1. For all the input registers, call `get()` of the bound nodes and set it to the register reading value
  2. Call all the process methods
  3. For all the output registers, call `set()` of the bound nodes with the register writing value
  4. For all the internal registers, copy the writing value to reading value
  5. Sleep until the next clock cycle
